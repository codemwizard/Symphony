They *can* all be Phase-0 **implementations**, but only **once the scripts/migrations actually exist and are wired into pre-CI + CI**. Until then they’re just **Phase-0 intentions** (plan + task meta), not enforced controls.

Here’s the clean mental model that matches your repo’s SKIPPED semantics and “Approach A”.

---

## 1) Are these all Phase-0 implementations?

### Phase-0 “implementation” means:

* a verifier/lint script exists **now**
* it runs in **local pre-CI** and **CI**
* it emits evidence JSON **every run**
* the contract requires that evidence **only when appropriate**

If the scripts are “scheduled to be created later,” then they are **not yet Phase-0 implementations**. They are **Phase-0 planned work**.

So: yes, they are *Phase-0 scoped*, but they’re not “implemented” until the scripts land + wiring lands.

---

## 2) Are the scripts scheduled to be created at implementation time?

Yes — that’s exactly what your task strategy says.

* The task meta can declare the invariant and intended evidence path,
* but the actual enforcement only exists once:

  1. the script exists,
  2. the gate exists in `CONTROL_PLANES.yml`,
  3. the ordered runner calls it,
  4. CI runs that same ordered runner.

That’s why **Approach A** exists: don’t put new evidence requirements in the contract until you can actually emit them deterministically.

---

## 3) “Only PLANNED invariants need SKIPPED stubs” — correct, but with one nuance

Your enforcement is **contract-driven**, not “manifest-driven”.

### What actually triggers “missing evidence” failures:

`verify_phase0_contract_evidence_status.sh` (and friends) only complain when:

* a task is **required by contract** (or treated as required by status rules), AND
* its evidence file(s) are **missing**, OR have wrong status for that task state.

So:

### ✅ If an invariant is merely listed in the manifest as roadmap/planned

…and **not required by the contract yet**, then **no SKIPPED stub is necessary**.

### ✅ If a task is in the contract but not implemented yet

Then you must choose:

* **Approach A:** don’t add it to the contract yet (no stub needed)
* **Approach B:** add it early, but provide a stub verifier that emits `SKIPPED` deterministically (otherwise CI fails)

That’s the real rule: **SKIPPED stubs are needed only for things that your contract expects evidence for, but aren’t enforceable yet.**

---

## 4) With Approach A, when does enforcement take place?

**Enforcement starts the moment you land the implementation PR that includes:**

1. the script(s) + migrations (if any),
2. the gate registration in `CONTROL_PLANES.yml`,
3. wiring into `run_phase0_ordered_checks.sh` (and thus pre-CI & CI),
4. **only then** add the evidence path(s) into `docs/PHASE0/phase0_contract.yml`.

So Approach A is “**late-binding contract**”:

* you build the gate first,
* you prove it emits evidence on every run,
* then you make it “contract-required”.

This avoids the exact failure mode you pasted (missing evidence for tasks that aren’t actually producing artifacts).

---

## 5) Practical timeline for a new Phase-0 gate under Approach A

**PR 1 (implementation + wiring, but NOT contract-required yet)**

* Add scripts/migration
* Add gate entry in CONTROL_PLANES
* Add call in ordered runner + pre_ci + CI
* Gate emits evidence, but contract does not require it yet → no “missing evidence” failures

**PR 2 (turn it into a contract requirement)**

* Add/flip the task status + evidence path requirement in `phase0_contract.yml`
* Now contract enforcement requires PASS/SKIPPED correctly

Most teams just do this in **one PR** by doing all four steps together once the script works.

---

## 6) Where people get burned (your current failure)

You got:

* remediation trace gate failing (“No TSK-P0 files found”)
* and contract evidence status failing (many “missing_evidence:*”)

Those are classic “contract ahead of implementation” symptoms:

* contract expects evidence for tasks whose evidence isn’t being produced in CI.

Approach A prevents that by making contract updates the *last* step, not the first.

---

## Bottom line rules (copy/paste-able)

* **Manifest/roadmap invariants do not require SKIPPED stubs** by themselves.
* **Contract-required evidence always requires deterministic emission**:

  * `PASS` for completed/enforced
  * `SKIPPED` only when the contract says it’s allowed to be skipped for that task state
  * never “missing”
* **Approach A**: don’t add a new evidence path to `phase0_contract.yml` until the gate is live in pre-CI & CI.
* **Approach B**: if you add to contract early, you *must* ship a stub that always emits `SKIPPED` until implementation.

If you paste (or re-upload) your current `phase0_contract.yml` section for the new tasks and the relevant portion of `run_phase0_ordered_checks.sh`, I can tell you exactly whether you’re currently in A or accidentally in B (and exactly what to change to get back to A without breaking SKIPPED semantics).













### Which approach are you in right now: A or B?

You are **in Approach B (declare early + require SKIPPED evidence)**.

Reason: your **Phase-0 contract already includes PLANNED tasks with evidence_paths**, and your CI failure is complaining that those evidence files are missing (e.g. `TSK-P0-037` is `planned` but still flagged as `missing_evidence`). That only happens when your enforcement expects **every contract entry to produce an evidence JSON every run**, where planned items must emit **`status: "SKIPPED"`** (not “missing”).

Also, `run_phase0_ordered_checks.sh` runs the contract evidence status gate at the end, so anything in the contract must be produced in the run (PASS/FAIL/SKIPPED), otherwise you get exactly the “missing_evidence” failures you’re seeing.

---

### Are these all Phase-0 implementations? When do scripts get created?

They *can be* Phase-0 implementations, but **the scripts aren’t “scheduled” automatically**—they must exist **before** you add their evidence paths to the contract **or** you must have **stub emitters** that output SKIPPED evidence until the real implementation lands.

Right now you have the “declare early” behavior (Approach B), **but you’re missing the SKIPPED stubs** for a bunch of contract items (and/or the gates are wired but not emitting the expected file).

---

### Clarify the rule: “Only PLANNED need SKIPPED stubs” — true?

**Mostly true, but incomplete:**

* **PLANNED** tasks in the contract **must emit `SKIPPED` evidence** every run (Approach B).
* **COMPLETED** tasks must emit **PASS/FAIL evidence** every run (PASS expected, FAIL allowed if the system regresses).
* **IN_PROGRESS** tasks (depending on how your checker is written) usually must emit evidence too; commonly **PASS/FAIL** (or SKIPPED only if explicitly allowed by contract semantics).

Your current error list includes **COMPLETED tasks missing evidence** (e.g., `TSK-P0-011`, `TSK-P0-028`, etc.), which is a separate correctness problem: those gates must be run and must write the evidence file.

---

### If you go with Approach A, when does enforcement take place?

In **Approach A (declare only when ready)**:

* Enforcement begins **only when you wire the gate into the ordered checks AND add the evidence_path into `phase0_contract.yml`**.
* Until then, the repo has **no mechanical requirement** to produce that evidence (so CI won’t fail for “missing evidence”).
* You also lose early “audit-visible” tracking of planned controls.

So Approach A is **simpler to keep CI green**, but it delays audit visibility and makes it easier to “forget” controls until late.

---

### Which option is better for Symphony?

Given your stated goal (“Tier-1 / regulator pre-audit ready” + “evidence-grade / fail-closed”):

✅ **Approach B is the better option** — **but only if you finish it properly**:

1. For every **PLANNED** item present in `phase0_contract.yml`, ensure an ordered-check step runs that **emits a SKIPPED evidence file** (with reason + gate_id/task_id).
2. For every **COMPLETED** item, ensure the actual verifier runs and always emits PASS/FAIL evidence (never missing).
3. Keep a single source of truth: contract → ordered checks → evidence files.

If you **don’t** want to invest in the stub infrastructure right now, then temporarily switch to **Approach A** by:

* removing PLANNED items (or their evidence requirements) from the contract **until the scripts exist**, **or**
* relaxing the checker so PLANNED items don’t require evidence.

But the clean long-term posture for Symphony is **Approach B + universal SKIPPED emitters**, because it prevents “silent drift” and makes the control backlog auditor-visible.

---

### Practical recommendation (what I’d do next)

* **Stay on Approach B** (you’re already there), and fix it by:

  1. Add a small helper like `scripts/audit/emit_skipped_evidence.sh` (or equivalent pattern you already use).
  2. In `run_phase0_ordered_checks.sh`, for each **planned-but-not-implemented** gate, call the stub emitter to write the expected evidence path with `status: "SKIPPED"`.
  3. For the **completed-but-missing** evidence items in your error list, wire/run the real scripts (or fix the evidence path mismatch).

If you paste your `verify_phase0_contract_evidence_status.sh` logic (or confirm its rules for planned/in_progress), I can tell you exactly whether it expects SKIPPED for **planned only** or also allows SKIPPED for **in_progress**—but even without that, the CI output you shared already proves you’re operating in **Approach B** today.
