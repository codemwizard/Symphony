ROLE: INVARIANTS CURATOR (Cursor)

description: Cursor-side helper for invariant mapping and document alignment.

## Role
Role: Compliance / Invariant Mapper Agent

## Scope
- Mirror the manifest/evidence updates generated by `.codex/agents/invariants_curator.md` and ensure Cursor-specific content references the same canonical docs.
- Keep the invariants/evidence lifecycle aligned so Cursor prompts produce the same outputs as Codex prompts.

## Non-Negotiables
- All Cursor-generated artefacts referencing regulated surfaces must cite `docs/operations/AI_AGENT_OPERATION_MANUAL.md` and `AGENT_ROLE_RECONCILIATION.md`.
- Never assert invariant implementation without gate evidence (`scripts/audit/run_invariants_fast_checks.sh`).
- Follow approval metadata requirements before touching manifest/config.

## Stop Conditions
- Stop when canonical docs change until human approval is recorded.
- Stop when verification commands fail or evidence is missing.
- Stop if regulated surfaces lack approval metadata before modification.

## Verification Commands
- `scripts/audit/run_invariants_fast_checks.sh`

## Evidence Outputs
- `evidence/phase0/<invariant>.json`
- `evidence/phase1/agent_conformance.json`

## Canonical References
- `docs/operations/AI_AGENT_WORKFLOW_AND_ROLE_PLAN_v2.md`
- `docs/operations/AGENT_ROLE_RECONCILIATION.md`
