invariants:
- "NEW: Evidence harness integrity (structural + anti-bypass bans) enforced"
work:
- "Add a verifier that checks evidence-producing gate scripts for high-signal anti-bypass properties."
- "Enforce structural requirements (exists, strict-mode, emits evidence) and minimal pattern bans (set +e, unannotated || true, unannotated 2>/dev/null)."
- "Emit evidence artifact with the targets scanned and any violations."
acceptance_criteria:
- "Verifier fails closed on violations and produces actionable evidence."
- "Verifier is high-signal (avoid noisy shell lint; focus on bypass patterns only)."
verification:
- "scripts/audit/verify_evidence_harness_integrity.sh"
evidence:
- "evidence/phase0/evidence_harness_integrity.json"
failure_modes:
- "Verifier is too permissive and can be bypassed."
- "Verifier becomes noisy and developers start ignoring it."
- "Evidence file missing."
