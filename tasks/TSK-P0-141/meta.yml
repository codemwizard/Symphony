invariants: []

work:
  - "Define Phase-0 performance posture in an auditor-legible doc: table classes, required indexes, required DB timeout posture, and waiver marker format tied to ADR references."
  - "Declare which checks are structural (catalog-based) vs static (SQL text scan) and what evidence artifacts they emit."
  - "Keep Phase-0 scope: no runtime load tests, no SLO enforcement."

acceptance_criteria:
  - "Doc exists under docs/PHASE0 and is referenced by the performance task cluster plans."
  - "Waiver format is explicit and machine-detectable (marker + ADR reference)."

verification:
  - "N/A (spec document)"

evidence: []

failure_modes:
  - "Spec is not actionable (no machine-detectable waiver format; unclear required indexes/timeouts)."
