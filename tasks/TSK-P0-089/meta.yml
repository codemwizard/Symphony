title: Tier-1 gap audit addendum (ISO 27001/27002, ISO 20022, Zero Trust, migrations)
owner_role: ARCHITECT
status: completed
depends_on:
- TSK-P0-088
touches:
- docs/audits/TIER1_GAP_AUDIT_ADDENDUM_2026-02-07.md

- tasks/TSK-P0-089/meta.yml
invariants: []
work:
- Extend the Tier-1 gap audit with ISO/IEC 27001:2022 and ISO/IEC 27002:2022 mapping (Phase-0 posture and gaps).
- Extend the Tier-1 gap audit with ISO 20022 expectations (message definitions, validation, integrity, non-repudiation) and Phase-0-safe hooks.
- Assess the current repo posture against Zero Trust Architecture principles and identify Phase-0 mechanical gaps.
- Document the exact forward-only, blue/green migration process in this repo, including preparatory invariants required for safe rollback-by-routing.
acceptance_criteria:
- Addendum is evidence-minded and references concrete scripts/docs/paths used in this repo.
- Addendum explicitly avoids compliance/certification claims and distinguishes Phase-0 hooks from runtime enforcement.
- Addendum includes concrete recommendations that do not violate hard constraints (no runtime DDL, forward-only migrations, append-only ledgers, revoke-first posture).
verification:
- scripts/audit/run_invariants_fast_checks.sh
evidence: []
failure_modes:
- Addendum over-claims compliance or misstates the repo’s migration mechanics.
