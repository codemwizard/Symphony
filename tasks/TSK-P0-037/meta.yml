title: "Phase-0 evidence contract + gate switch (authoritative)"
owner_role: "PLATFORM"
Depends On: TSK-P0-010, TSK-P0-034
Touches:
  - "docs/PHASE0/PHASE0_CONTRACT.md"
  - "docs/PHASE0/phase0_contract.yml"

Invariant(s): "INV-060 (Phase-0 contract governs evidence gate)"
Work:
  - "Create phase0_contract.yml as the single source of truth for evidence enforcement."
  - "Validate schema, completeness, and duplicate/unknown task IDs."
  - "Update evidence gate to honor contract status and normalize CI paths."
Acceptance Criteria:
  - "Contract validates and lists every Phase-0 task."
  - "Evidence gate enforces only completed tasks with evidence_required=true."
  - "Evidence file is written even when validation fails."
Verification Commands:
  - "scripts/audit/verify_phase0_contract.sh"
  - "CI_ONLY=1 scripts/ci/check_evidence_required.sh evidence/phase0"
Evidence Artifact(s):
  - "./evidence/phase0/phase0_contract.json"
Failure Modes:
  - "Evidence file missing."
  - "Missing/duplicate task rows in contract."
  - "Evidence gate fails on tasks not marked completed."
