invariants:
- INV-049 (Local CI parity enforced)
work:
- Add destructive local CI runner that mirrors GitHub Actions job order.
- Require CI_WIPE=1 to proceed; wipe and recreate dev DB before running.
- Use Postgres 18 via docker service for parity.
- Emit ./evidence/phase0/local_ci_parity.json.
acceptance_criteria:
- Runner exits non-zero on any failed step.
- Runner wipes DB only when CI_WIPE=1 is set.
- Evidence file is written by the runner.
verification:
- CI_WIPE=1 DATABASE_URL=postgres://symphony_admin:symphony_pass@127.0.0.1:5432/symphony
  scripts/ci/run_ci_locally.sh
evidence:
- ./evidence/phase0/local_ci_parity.json
failure_modes:
- Evidence file missing.
- Runner does not wipe DB when required.
- Local CI steps diverge from CI workflow order.
