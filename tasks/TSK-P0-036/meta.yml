title: "Local CI parity runner (wipe + full pipeline)"
owner_role: "PLATFORM"
Depends On: TSK-P0-010, TSK-P0-030, TSK-P0-034
Touches:
  - "scripts/ci/run_ci_locally.sh"
  - "docs/operations/LOCAL_CI_PARITY.md"
  - "docs/operations/DEV_WORKFLOW.md"
  - "tasks/TSK-P0-036/meta.yml"
Invariant(s): "INV-049 (Local CI parity enforced)"
Work:
  - "Add destructive local CI runner that mirrors GitHub Actions job order."
  - "Require CI_WIPE=1 to proceed; wipe and recreate dev DB before running."
  - "Use Postgres 18 via docker service for parity."
  - "Emit ./evidence/phase0/local_ci_parity.json."
Acceptance Criteria:
  - "Runner exits non-zero on any failed step."
  - "Runner wipes DB only when CI_WIPE=1 is set."
  - "Evidence file is written by the runner."
Verification Commands:
  - "CI_WIPE=1 DATABASE_URL=postgres://symphony_admin:symphony_pass@127.0.0.1:5432/symphony scripts/ci/run_ci_locally.sh"
Evidence Artifact(s):
  - "./evidence/phase0/local_ci_parity.json"
Failure Modes:
  - "Evidence file missing."
  - "Runner does not wipe DB when required."
  - "Local CI steps diverge from CI workflow order."
