invariants:
- "NEW: ISO 20022 readiness and Zero Trust posture docs exist and are referenced by SECURITY_MANIFEST"
work:
- "Define Phase-0 ISO 20022 readiness posture: message contract registry location, validation expectations, and planned adapter contract tests."
- "Define Phase-0 Zero Trust posture: identity model, policy decision/enforcement points, and telemetry minimums, with explicit Phase-1/2 follow-ups."
- "Add verifiers that fail closed if required posture docs are missing or unreferenced by SECURITY_MANIFEST."
- "Add a verifier that fails closed if the ISO 20022 contract registry is missing (or unparseable) and emits presence evidence."
acceptance_criteria:
- "Docs exist under docs/security, are referenced by SECURITY_MANIFEST, and verifiers emit evidence."
- "Docs clearly separate Phase-0 hooks from Phase-1/2 runtime enforcement."
