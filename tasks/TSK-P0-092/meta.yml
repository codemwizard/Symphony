invariants:
- "NEW: Semgrep SAST baseline runs (pinned) and emits evidence (SKIPPED allowed locally if tool missing)"
work:
- "Add a Secure SDLC policy stub that defines minimum static gates and evidence expectations in Phase-0."
- "Introduce a Phase-0 Semgrep baseline (minimal repo-managed ruleset, pinned tool version) and emit evidence with tool version + scanned paths."
- "Wire SAST baseline into CI/pre-CI gating and map it in SECURITY_MANIFEST."
acceptance_criteria:
- "SAST baseline runner is deterministic and runs in both local and CI."
- "Evidence artifact includes tool version, git_sha, scanned file set, and status."

failure_modes:
- "SAST baseline only runs in CI (local parity broken)."
- "SAST output is non-deterministic or missing provenance fields."
