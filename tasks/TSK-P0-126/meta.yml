invariants: []

work:
  - "Confirm and document that migration expand/contract enforcement and PK/FK stability already exist as INV-097/INV-098."
  - "Confirm and document that table conventions verification already exists as INV-099."
  - "Update the Sovereign Hybrid Cloud Phase-0 plan to reuse these invariants rather than creating new IDs/scripts."

acceptance_criteria:
  - "Sovereign Hybrid Cloud Phase-0 plan references INV-097/INV-098/INV-099 and does not propose duplicate implementations."

verification:
  - "N/A (planning reconciliation only)"

evidence: []

failure_modes:
  - "Plan proposes new invariants that collide with existing invariant meanings."
  - "Plan schedules redundant work that already exists and is enforced."
