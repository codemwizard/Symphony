Status: APPROVED  
Approval Date (UTC): 2026-02-11T12:30:00Z

## 1. Summary of Change

**Short description (required):**
Updated the Phase-1 agent governance manual and verifier so canonical rules, stop conditions, and regulated-surface approvals are enforced deterministically.

**Reason for change (required):**
Establish the Phase-1 agent operation manual as the single source of truth and make `verify_agent_conformance.sh` fail closed when the manual or approvals are missing.
