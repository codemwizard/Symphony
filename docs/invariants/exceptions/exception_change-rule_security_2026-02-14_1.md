# Exception: security structural change without invariants linkage

This exception was auto-generated by local preflight because a structural change was detected,
but invariants linkage (manifest/docs with INV-###) was not included in the same commit.

## Reason

This exception allows a structural update to the security grant lint so it catches
forbidden CREATE grants on schema public even when the SQL statement is not terminated
with a semicolon.

## Evidence

structural_change: True
confidence_hint: 1.0
primary_reason: security
reason_types: security

Matched files:
- scripts/security/lint_privilege_grants.sh

Top matches:
- security | scripts/security/lint_privilege_grants.sh | +: # Match both semicolon-terminated and EOF-terminated grant statements.
- security | scripts/security/lint_privilege_grants.sh | -: while (/GRANT\s+CREATE\s+ON\s+SCHEMA\s+public\s+TO\s+([^;]+);/ig) {
- security | scripts/security/lint_privilege_grants.sh | +: while (/GRANT\s+CREATE\s+ON\s+SCHEMA\s+public\s+TO\s+([^;]+)(?:;|\z)/ig) {

## Mitigation

- Lint remains fail-closed for all existing semicolon-terminated grant regressions.
- New detection closes a formatting bypass rather than broadening permissions.
- Follow-up ticket tracks invariants-linkage housekeeping for this structural lint update.
