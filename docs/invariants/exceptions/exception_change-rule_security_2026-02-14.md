# Exception: security structural change without invariants linkage

This exception was auto-generated by local preflight because a structural change was detected,
but invariants linkage (manifest/docs with INV-###) was not included in the same commit.

## Reason

This exception allows a structural security-lint improvement to land without bundling invariants
manifest/docs updates in the same commit. The change is narrowly scoped to detection accuracy for
forbidden CREATE grants split across multiple SQL lines.

## Evidence

structural_change: True
confidence_hint: 1.0
primary_reason: security
reason_types: security

Matched files:
- scripts/security/lint_privilege_grants.sh

Top matches:
- security | scripts/security/lint_privilege_grants.sh | -: if grep -Eqi "GRANT\s+CREATE\s+ON\s+SCHEMA\s+public\s+TO\s+(PUBLIC|symphony_)" "$file"; then
- security | scripts/security/lint_privilege_grants.sh | +: while (/GRANT\s+CREATE\s+ON\s+SCHEMA\s+public\s+TO\s+([^;]+);/ig) {

## Mitigation

- The lint remains fail-closed for explicit forbidden grants.
- New multiline detection expands coverage without relaxing any deny condition.
- Follow-up ticket will add/confirm invariants linkage for this structural tooling change.
