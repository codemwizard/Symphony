# Execution Log (TSK-P0-125)

scope: "Scaffolding only (plan + tasks). No code, schema, or workflow implementation executed in this task."

Plan: `docs/plans/phase0/TSK-P0-125_sovereign_hybrid_cloud_reg_machine/PLAN.md`

## Change Applied
- Added cluster implementation plan:
  - `docs/plans/phase0/TSK-P0-125_sovereign_hybrid_cloud_reg_machine/PLAN.md`
- Added task scaffolding for the planned workstream (see `tasks/TSK-P0-125..130/meta.yml`).

## Verification Commands Run
verification_commands_run:
- "N/A (planning/scaffolding task only)"

## Status
final_status: PASS (scaffold created; implementation intentionally not started)

## Final Summary
Created the Phase-0 Sovereign Hybrid Cloud cluster plan and task scaffolding with non-colliding invariant/gate allocations and explicit intent boundaries. No implementation work was performed under this task by design.
