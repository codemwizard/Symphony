# Symphony Vision

Symphony is a clean-slate financial platform designed with:

- **Strict Posture Defaults**: No runtime DDL, mechanical invariant verification
- **Bottom-Up Architecture**: Each layer proven before the next is added
- **Regulatory Alignment**: Phase-gated development with audit trails

## Core Principles

1. **Immutability First**: Financial records are append-only
2. **Fail-Closed Security**: Missing controls block deployment
3. **Mechanical Verification**: Invariants enforced by code, not documentation
4. **Deterministic State**: Database state derivable from migrations

## Target Capabilities

- ISO 20022-compliant payment orchestration
- Multi-tenant participant management
- Policy-gated transaction processing
- Append-only ledger with double-entry integrity
